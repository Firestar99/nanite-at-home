# Models

The `./models` directory will be searched recursively for glTF files (`*.gltf`, `*.glb`) when building, so that any model within this directory will be preprocessed and accessible from the application.

The `./models/local` directory may contain user gltf models for local use, which are git ignored. Feel free to symlink some in!
